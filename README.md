This repo is simply a patch version of https://github.com/grantslatton/llama.cpp. This was done so it can easily be applied to the latest version of the llama.cpp repo.

Additionally this repo is a place for exploring constrained llm responses and may become part of a larger project where constrained llm responses are parsed and used for downstream uses.
